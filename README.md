## Sentiment Analysis Project

This program performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of Amazon product reviews.

First it selectes the column containing the data necesary for the project, then it cleans the text from
those words that do not aport meaning to the analysis and finally using NLP (Natural Language Programming)
it analizes the polarity of the reviews contained in a csv dataset and with that polarity it can determine 
the sentiment of the text.

### Installation

To run this program make sure that both files the csv file containing the dataset and the 
sentiment_analysis.py are in the same folder.

### Usage

When you run the program it will load all the packages needed to execute.
